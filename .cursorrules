# Project Rules for AI Assistant

## Documentation
- **Do NOT create summary or implementation explanation MD files**
- Only create new MD files when explicitly requested by the user
- Keep documentation in existing files: README.md, backend/README.md, frontend/README.md, etc.

## Code Changes
- Make direct code changes without creating summary documents
- Explain changes conversationally in responses, not in new files

## Exceptions
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in backend/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md are OK to update
- User explicitly requests a new documentation file
